I created a rails application for shippers to help them organize all of thier ships in their fleet. The shipper will be able to add boats to their fleet, give them a unique name, tally the amount of containers and name it's current location.

The shipper will create jobs for the boats which will consist of containers needed, cargo, point of orgin & destination and the cost of the job.

I used validations, uniqueness and hard coded lists for data entry. There are 4 data tables that are related to each other. I also used the paperclip gem so that the shipper can upload photos of their ship when it's being created.

Moving forward with this project, I will create a feature where the shipper can follow other ships that they like and save them to their profile. I will create a page where the shippers can see what ships they are currently following and see who is following their ships.
